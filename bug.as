This ActionScript bug involves incorrect handling of event listeners when dealing with dynamically added display objects.  Specifically, the problem arises when an event listener is attached to a MovieClip that's later removed from the display list, but the event listener isn't properly removed. This can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior because the target object of the event listener no longer exists.
